Periods where the ATR% falls below the dotted green line at 3% indicate low volatility, which is typically associated with more stable market conditions. In contrast, noticeable spikes—such as those seen in 2020 and 2021—reflect periods of heightened volatility. More recently, ATR% values appear to remain closer to or slightly above the low-volatility threshold, suggesting relatively calmer market behavior compared to earlier years.\n\nThe chart displays ATR% for TSLA during 2025, reflecting how the stock's volatility has evolved since the start of the year. While ATR% began above the 7% mark in early January, it gradually declined and remained mostly between 4% and 6% throughout February. Although volatility did not breach the low-volatility threshold of 3%, the dip toward that level suggests a period of relative calm. Toward early March, ATR% showed a clear upward trend, indicating a potential resurgence in market volatility.\n\nThe chart illustrates the closing price of Tesla stock over time, with overlaid trading signals generated by the strategy. Green upward triangles represent buy signals, while red downward triangles mark sell signals. These signals are distributed throughout periods of both rising and falling prices, reflecting how the algorithm dynamically enters and exits positions based on market conditions. Clusters of signals during high-volatility periods—such as 2020, 2021, and early 2025—indicate frequent entries and exits, whereas more stable phases show fewer trades.\n\nThe chart displays the historical closing price of Tesla (TSLA) stock alongside algorithmically generated buy and sell signals. The blue line represents TSLA's closing price, while the green upward-pointing triangles indicate buy entries—distinguished by lime green for aggressive entries (lower volatility) and dark green for conservative entries (higher volatility). Red downward-pointing triangles represent sell signals.\n\nThe buy signals are generally aligned with upward momentum, and sell signals frequently follow periods of short-term retracement or heightened volatility. The system shows particularly dense activity around highly volatile phases, such as mid-2020 to early 2022, capturing many entries and exits. In contrast, during more stable periods, the signals are more spaced out. Overall, the plot provides a clear visual assessment of how the strategy adapts dynamically to changing market conditions by modulating its entries based on volatility and exiting with protective trailing logic.\n\n## Tesla Analysis Results\n\nThe backtest results show that while the strategy achieved a total return of approximately 62.76%, it significantly underperformed compared to a simple buy-and-hold strategy on TSLA, which yielded a 1215.81% return. The strategy executed 80 trades with a low win rate of 32.5%, indicating that most trades were unprofitable. Although it had a few strong winners, the average profit per trade was marginal, with a profit factor of 1.19. Additionally, the portfolio experienced a substantial maximum drawdown of 55.35% and a prolonged recovery period lasting two years, signaling high risk. Visuals further confirm that many trades resulted in small losses or gains, with only a few notable profitable exits. Overall, while the strategy demonstrates some profitability, its risk-return profile is weak and may require optimization in entry/exit logic, volatility filtering, or sentiment integration to compete with the benchmark performance.\n\n## XLY Analysis Results\n\n### Without sentiment code\n\n## SPY Analysis Results\n\n## Optimization\n\n## Peer Comparison: Apple Analysis Results \n\n### Without Sentiment\n\nBased on the results from applying the trading strategy to the Apple (AAPL) ticker, we can reasonably conclude that the strategy does work on peers like AAPL. The strategy delivered a total return of approximately 282% over the backtest period (2019–2025), compared to a benchmark return of about 526%, which indicates it captured a significant portion of the upward trend while actively managing trades. Although it underperformed the benchmark in absolute terms, this is typical of signal-driven strategies that trade in and out of the market. The profit factor of 2.11, expectancy of 4204, and a win rate of 45.5% suggest the strategy was profitable overall. Additionally, the drawdown was moderate (20.87%), reflecting a reasonable risk exposure relative to the potential reward.\n\nThe cumulative returns graph further supports this interpretation. The strategy closely follows the broader market trend, generating consistent gains and outperforming during certain periods. The trade PnL distribution shows a good number of winning trades with healthy profitability, and although there were losses, the downside was generally contained. Therefore, this peer comparison confirms that the strategy generalizes reasonably well beyond TSLA, making it a potentially viable approach for other high-liquidity technology stocks like AAPL.\n\n## VI Plots\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n\n## Importing Necessary Libraries for Analysis\n\n## Data Collection\n\n### Fetch daily OHLCV data \n\n### Fetch sentiment scores from the API\n\n## Indicator Calculation\n\n### Compute VI+ and VI-\n\n### Calculate Volume-Weighted Sentiment \n\n### Derive ATR (10) for Volatility Adjustments\n\nThe chart illustrates the historical volatility of TSLA, measured by the Average True Range (ATR) as a percentage of the closing price.
